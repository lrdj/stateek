        <q>I was stuck in an endless loop, questioning past decisions and second-guessing my moves. It was completely paralysing – both in making new choices and in feeling confident about my life’s direction. The Checkpoint session at Clarity Lab helped me get off that track. In just one conversation, I went from ruminating on the past to seeing the potential for change. I did come away with clarity, a lot of relief, and the ability to pivot towards what really matters to me. If you feel stuck, don’t hesitate – this process works.</q></h3>
